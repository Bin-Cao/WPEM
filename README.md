# WPEM
A X-ray Diffraction Refinement Software

My master dissertation give a detailed introduction of the beta version of WPEM : see [Link](https://github.com/Bin-Cao/MPhil_SHU)

The official release version will meet with you as soon as possible

----

WPEM specializes in determining the complex crystal structures and decoupling heavily overlapped Bragg peaks from mixed X-rays and polycrystalline powder diffraction. We have acquired several excellent research results including quantitative detection of similar structures with tiny differences i.e., α phase and α' phase of Ti-Ni alloy, separating contributions of amorphous and crystalline in Polybutene, etc. We are willing to cooperate extensively and provide assistance with X-ray diffraction pattern refinement. Please contact us if you have any queries or need help: binjacobcao@gmail.com (Dr. CAO Bin).
