This application calculates the angle between two vectors using the given components V1 and V2,and lattice constants a, b, c, and lattice angles alpha, beta, gamma. 

It provides options to select the type of massion: lattice plane or lattice vector.
The angle is calculated based on the given inputs and displayed.
